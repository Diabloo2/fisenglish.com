      <h1>  6 Types of Conflict in Literature:<br/>
         Character vs Anything! </h1>
         <p> In literature, conflict is any struggle that characters must overcome to
         <br/> achieve their goal. It can be a ‘real world’ obstacle or antagonist (external
         <br/> conflict) or some inner turmoil that our heroes must confront before getting
         <br/> what they want or need (internal conflict).  </p>
         <p> As we mentioned in the previous section, all good stories are driven by
         <br/> conflict. By understanding what stands between characters and their goals,
         <br/> we can begin to grasp what their stories are about. The seven most common
         <br/> types of conflict in literature are:</p>
         <br/>
         <br/>
         <a name="ch"></a>
         <h1> 1. Character vs. Character(s)</h1>
         <p> Also called <b> protagonist vs. antagonist </b> , this is the most common
         <br/> type of external conflict. It is clear and universally understood as a good vs. evil story
         <br/> in which an unambiguous challenger opposes the main character. </p>
         <p> The heart of this type of story involves two characters with opposing outlooks,
            <br/> opinions, or goals. The story will become richer when both characters believe
            <br/> themselves to be right or when there is no clear right or wrong between their
            <br/> differences. </p> 
            <h2> Examples of character vs. character conflict
            </h2>
            <p> <b> Les Misérables: </b> Former convict Jean Valjean restarts his life with a new
            <br/> identity, seeking to create a more just society for the underclasses. He is
            <br/> discovered and pursued by Inspector Javert, whose fanatical devotion to the
            <br/> law has blinded him to the actual injustices being perpetrated by the system.

            </p>

            <br/>
            <a name="so"></a>
            <h1> 2. Character vs. Society </h1>
            <p> <p> Particularly prevalent in fiction these days, this type of external struggle pits
                <br/> the individual against the collective. In this case, “the collective” might take
                <br/> the form of something like:
                <br/><b> . </b>an oppressive government,<br/>
                <b>. </b>adults (as seen from a teenager’s perspective), or<br/>
                <b> .</b>systemic corruption.<br/>
                 </p>
                 <p> In this type of conflict, society will put pressure on our character to change
                 <br/> and fall neatly into order. On the other hand, our protagonist will resist this
                 <br/> change and, in extreme cases, will try to bend society to fit their vision. Like
                 <br/> the story of David and Goliath, our hero faces an uphill battle, but the reader
                 <br/> holds out hope that ‘the little guy’ can overcome a seemingly impossible
                 <br/> challenge. </p>
                 <h2> Examples of character vs. society conflict</h2> 
                 <p> <b> The Hate U Give: </b> When her friend is shot dead by a cop, African American
                <br/> teenager Starr seeks justice, but finds herself up against a system of
                <br/> structural racism that stretches from the police and media, all the way to
                <br/> her private school and internalized racism. </p>

            <h1> 3. Character vs. Nature </h1>
            <p> How do you fancy your chances in a fight against Mother Earth? In this type
            <br/> of conflict, that is exactly what our protagonists are facing. Whether it’s
            <br/> wildlife (Jaws), natural disasters (The Day After Tomorrow), the weather (The
            <br/> Perfect Storm), or a post-apocalyptic landscape (The Road), the antagonists
            <br/> in this type of conflict cannot be reasoned with. </p>
            <p> Stories that feature a “character vs. nature” conflict will usually center on a
            <br/> character’s survival. In the absence of a human antagonist, our heroes will
            <br/> often discover that “character vs. self” conflict (something we will touch on
            <br/> later) is at the heart of their narrative arc. </p>
            <h2> Examples of character vs. nature conflict</h2>
            <p> <b> The Martian: </b>  Stranded on the Red Planet, astronaut Mark Watney must
            <br/> overcome its unforgiving environment and survive long enough to be
            <br/> rescued. Using his resourcefulness, he must overcome the obstacles that
            <br/> Mars presents by growing food and find a way to communicate with Earth.</p>

            <h1> 4. Character vs. Technology</h1>
            <p> Since the dawn of the industrial age, humanity has had a turbulent
            <br/> relationship with technology. Some see scientific progress as a defiance of
            <br/> God and the natural, while others have used it to question the limits of our
            <br/> morality, patience, and greed. While the idea of ‘character vs. technology’
            <br/> might summon up the image of a Terminator-like robot apocalypse, this
            <br/> type of conflict could also be as modest as someone struggling to teach
            <br/> their Grandma Millie how to use emojis! </p>
            <h2> Examples of character vs. technology</h2>
            <p> 1984. This classic by George Orwell takes place in the year 1984. It is a dystopian
                <br/> future ravaged by war and civil strife.
                <br/>
                <br/>

                The world is now under a totalitarian regime where everyone is forced to adhere
                <br/> to the regime’s rules. The regime uses television screens, cameras, and hidden
                <br/>
                 microphones to keep tabs on the people. </p>

            <h1> 5. Character vs. Supernatural</h1>
            <p> When your hero finds themselves up against something that cannot be
            <br/> explained by logic or science, they are probably in conflict with
            <br/> supernatural forces! While some writers employ this type of conflict to tell
            <br/> rip-roaring tales, supernatural stories can also explore human fears and
            <br/> inexplicable everyday events.
            <br/>
            <br/>

                  In practice, character vs supernatural conflicts will often see the
            <br/> protagonist face off against the forces of fate, religion, ghosts, gods, demons
            <br/> or aliens.</p>
            <h2> Examples of character vs supernatural</h2>
            <p> <b> Ghostbusters:</b> Three disgraced scientists (and a guy they find on Craigslist)
                <br/> set up shop as supernatural pest controllers, ridding New York of hungry
                <br/> ghosts and spectral librarians. But when a Sumerian god arrives looking to
                <br/> enslave the world, our four heroes must answer the age-old question: does
                <br/> bustin’ make them feel good? </p>

            <h1> 6. Character vs. Self </h1>
            <p> Writer Maxwell Anderson once said that “the story must be a conflict, and
            <br/> specifically, a conflict between the forces of good and evil within a single
            <br/> person”. Though that might be an oversimplification, every interesting story
            <br/> will indeed, at some point, involve a character’s inner dilemma. That’s
            <br/> because, as James N. Frey points out in How To Write A Damn Good Novel, a
            <br/> reader experiences the most empathy for a character when that character is
            <br/> in the middle of some intense inner strife.</p>
            <h2> Examples of character vs. self</h2>
            <p> <b> The Hunger Games: </b> Kind-hearted teen Katniss Everdeen is drafted as a
            <br/> contestant in a deadly reality show staged by a totalitarian government. As
            <br/> per the rules of the game, in the end, there can be only one — to survive, it
            <br/> seems that Katniss must overcome her reluctance to kill. Will she stick by
            <br/> her principles, even if it ultimately results in her death? </p>
